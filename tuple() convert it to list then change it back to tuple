#Change Tuple Values
#Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.
#But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[2] = "durian"
x = tuple(y)
print(x)
