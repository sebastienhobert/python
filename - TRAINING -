# Function Main()

# Define function "getInteger"
# This function prompts the user to enter a number through the input() function.
# The entered value is then converted to an integer using int(), and the result is stored in the number variable.
# Finally, the function returns the entered integer.

# Define function "main"
# It calls the getInteger() function and assigns its return value to the variable output.
# Then, it prints the value of output.

# Use the special variable "__name__"
# It checks whether the script is being run as the main program (not imported as a module).
# If the condition is true, it calls the Main() function.
# This is a common practice in Python to ensure that the code inside the Main() function
# is executed only when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.
