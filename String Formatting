"""
To make sure a string will display as expected, we can format the result with the format() method


STRING FORMAT()
The format() method allows you to format selected parts of a string
Sometimes there are parts of a text that you do not control, maybe they come from a database, or user input?
To control such values, add placeholders (curly brackers {}) in the text, and run the values through the format() method
"""

#Ex: add a placeholder where you want to display the value
price = 49
txt = "The price is {} dollars"
print(txt.format(price))


"""
You can add parameters inside the curly brackets to specify how to convert the value
"""
#Ex: format the price to be displayed as a number with two decimals
price = 50
txt = "The price is {:.2f} dollars"
print(txt.format(price))


"""
MULTIPLE VALUES
If you want to use more values, just add more values to the format() method
"""
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 51

myorder = "I want {} pieces of item number {} for {:.2f} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
