PARAMETERS / ARGUMENTS

The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.

From a function's perspective:
- A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
- An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

SELF

The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

self allows each instance of a class to maintain its own state. Each instance has its own separate copy of instance variables.

By using self, Python provides a way for methods to operate on specific instances of a class, allowing for the creation and manipulation of objects with their own unique data.
