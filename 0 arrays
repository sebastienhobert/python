"""
The Length of an array
Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in an array)
Ex: return the number of elements in the cars array: 
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
x = len(cars)
print(x)



"""
Looping Array Elements
You can use the 'for in' loop to loop through all all the elements of an array
Ex: print each item in the cars array:
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
for x in cars:
    print(x)



"""
Adding Array Elements
You can use the append() method to add an element to an array.
Ex: add one more element to the cars array:
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars.append("Honda")
print(cars)



"""
Removing Array Elements
You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array
Ex: delete the second element of the cars array:
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars.pop(1)
print(cars)



"""
You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array:
Ex: delete the element that has the value "Volvo":
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars.remove("Volvo")
print(cars)
