"""
To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function
'a' - append - will append to the end of file
'w' - write - will overwrite any existent content
"""
#Ex: open the file "test.txt" and append content to the file
f = open("test.txt", "a")
f.write("Now the file has more content!")
f.close()

#Open and read the file after the appending
f = open("test.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

#Ex: open the file "test2.txt" and overwrite the content
f = open("test2.txt", "w")
f.write("Oopsie! I have deleted the content!")
f.close()

#Open and read the file after the overwriting
f = open("test2.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

#NOTE - the "w" method will overwrite the entire file

"""
CREATE A NEW FILE 
To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters

'x' - create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist
'a' - append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist
'w' - write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist 
"""

#Ex: create a file called "test.txt"
f = open("test.txt", "x")
#Result: a new empty file is created!

#Ex: create a new file if it does not exist
f = open("test.txt", "w")
