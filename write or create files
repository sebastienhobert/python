CREATE A NEW FILE 
To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters

'x' - create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist
'a' - append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist
'w' - write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist 
"""

#Ex: create a file called "test.txt"
f = open("test.txt", "x")
#Result: a new empty file is created!

#Ex: create a new file if it does not exist
f = open("test.txt", "w")
