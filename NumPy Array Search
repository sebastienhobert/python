"""
SEARCHING ARRAYS
You can search an array for a certain value, and return the indexes that get a match.
To search an array, use the where() method.
"""
#Ex: find the indexes where the value is 4
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4])
x = np.where(arr == 4)
print(x)
#The example will return a tuple (array[3, 5, 6],) which means that the value 4 is present at index 3, 5 and 6


#Ex: find the indexes where the values are even:
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
x = np.where(arr%2 == 0)
print(x)

#Ex: find the indexes where the values are odd:
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
x = np.where(arr%2 == 1)
print(x)
