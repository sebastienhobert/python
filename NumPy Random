GENERATE RANDOM FLOAT
The random module's rand() method returns a random float between 0 and 1.
Generate a random float from 0 to 1

RANDOM DISTRIBUTION
Ex: return one of the values in an array

"""
RANDOM DISTRIBUTION
The choice() methods allows us to specify the probability for each value.
The probability is set by a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the value will never occur and 1 means that the value will always occur.
Ex: generate a 1-D array containing 100 values, where each value has to be 3, 5, 7 or 9
The probability for the value to be 3 is set to be 0.1
The probability for the value to be 5 is set to be 0.3
The probability for the value to be 7 is set to be 0.6
The probability for the value to be 9 is set to be 0
