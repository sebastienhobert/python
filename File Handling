"""
SYNTAX
To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file
"""
f = open("test.txt")

"""
The code above is the same as
"""
f = open("test.txt", "rt")

"""
Because "r" for read, and "t" for text are the default values, you do not need to specify them
"""



"""
OPEN A FILE ON THE SERVER
Assume we have the following file , located in the same folder as Python
"""

#test.txt

"""
To open the file, use the built-in open() function
The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of a file 
"""

#Ex:
f = open ("test.txt", "r")
print(f.read())


"""
READ ONLY PARTS OF THE FILE
By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify many characters you want to return
"""
#Ex: return the 5 first characters of the file
f = open("test.txt", "r")
print(f.read(5))
