"""
Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable
Create an array containing car names:
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]



"""
What is an array?
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
If you have a list of items (a list of car names,  for example), storing the cars in single variable coud look like this:
"""
car1 = "Ford"
car2 = "Volvo"
car3 = "BMW"
"""
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? and what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?
The solution is an array!
An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the value by referring to an index number.
"""



"""
Access the elements of an erray
You refer to an array element by referring to the index number
Ex: get the value of the first array item
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
x = cars[0] 
print(x)




"""
Ex: modify the value of the first array item
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars[0] = "Toyota"
print(cars)




"""
The Length of an array
Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in an array)
Ex: return the number of elements in the cars array: 
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
x = len(cars)
print(x)



"""
Looping Array Elements
You can use the 'for in' loop to loop through all all the elements of an array
Ex: print each item in the cars array:
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
for x in cars:
    print(x)



"""
Adding Array Elements
You can use the append() method to add an element to an array.
Ex: add one more element to the cars array:
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars.append("Honda")
print(cars)



"""
Removing Array Elements
You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array
Ex: delete the second element of the cars array:
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars.pop(1)
print(cars)



"""
You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array:
Ex: delete the element that has the value "Volvo":
"""
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
cars.remove("Volvo")
print(cars)
