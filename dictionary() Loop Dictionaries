#Loop Through a Dictionary
#you can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop.
#When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict:
    print(x)


#Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict:
    print(thisdict[x])


#You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict.values():
    print(x)


#You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict.keys():
    print(x)


#Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict.items():
    print(x)
