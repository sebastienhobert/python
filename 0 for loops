#Nested Loops
#A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.
#The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop"
#Example: print each adjective for every fruit.
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in adj:
    for y in fruits:
        print(x, y)


#The pass Statement
#for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
