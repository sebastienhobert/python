#The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3):
for x in range (2, 20, 3):
    print(x)



#Else in For Loop
#The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished 
#Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:
for x in range(6):
    print(x)
else:
    print("Finally finished")
    
#NOTE- The else bloxk will not be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement
#Break the loop when x is 3, and see what happens with the else block:
for x in range(6):
    if x == 3: break
    print(x)
else:
    print("Finally finished!")


#Nested Loops
#A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.
#The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop"
#Example: print each adjective for every fruit.
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in adj:
    for y in fruits:
        print(x, y)


#The pass Statement
#for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
