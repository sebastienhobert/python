"""
CREATE A NUMPY NDARRAY OBJECT
NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray
We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function
"""

"""
To create an ndarray, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the array() method, and it will be converted into an ndarray  
"""
#Ex: use a tuple to create a NumPy array
import numpy as np
arr = np.array((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
print(arr)



"""
DIMENSIONS IN ARRAYS
A dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays)
====> nested array: are arrays that have arrays as their elements
"""

"""
0-D Arrays 
0-D arrays, or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array.  
"""
#Ex: create a 0-D array with value 42
import numpy as np
arr = np.array(42)
print(arr)



"""
1-D Arrays
An erray that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array
These are the most common and basic arrays
"""
#Ex: create a 1-D array containing the values 1,2,3,4,5
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
