WHAT IS A MODULE? 
Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
"""

"""
CREATE A MODULE
To create a module just save the code you want in a file wit the the extension .py:
"""

#Ex: save this code in a file named mymodule.py
def greeting(name):
    print("Hello," + name)


"""
USE A MODULE
Now we can use the module we just created, by using the import statement 
"""
#Ex: import the module named mymodule, and call the greeting function
import mymodule

mymodule.greeting("Sebastien")
