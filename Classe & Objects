"""
Python is an oriented programming language
Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods
A class is like an object constructor, or a blueprint for creating objects
"""

"""
To create a class, use the keyword class
Ex: create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
"""
class Myclass:
    x = 5
