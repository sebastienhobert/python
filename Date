PYTHON DATES
A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects
"""
#Ex: import the datetime module and display the current date
import datetime
x = datetime.datetime.now()
print(x)



"""
DATE OUTPUT 
When we execute the code from the example above the result will be:
2023-05-25 15:32:40.345581

The date contains year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond
The datetime module has many methods to return information about the data object

Here are a few examples, you will learn more about them later in this chapter
"""
#Ex: return the year and name of weekday
import datetime

x = datetime.datetime.now()

print(x.year)
print(x.strftime("%A"))
