#example1
adder = lambda x, y: x + y
print (adder (1, 2))

#example2 == lambda simply returning function object, and not being called by print().
string='some kind of a useless lambda'
print(lambda string : print(string))

#example3 == the lambda is being called, and the string we pass gets printed at the console.
x="some kind of a useless lambda"
(lambda x : print(x))(x)
