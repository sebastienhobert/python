#Python For Loops
#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary, set, string)

#Looping Through a String
#Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters
#Ex: loop through the letter in the word "banana"
for x in "banana":
    print(x)
    
    
#The break Statement
#With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all items:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break
