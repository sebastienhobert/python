#Python For Loops
#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary, set, string)

#Looping Through a String
#Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters
#Ex: loop through the letter in the word "banana"
for x in "banana":
    print(x)
    
    
#The break Statement
#With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all items:

#Exit the loop when x is "banana"
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break

#Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x)


#The continue Statement
#With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop,
#and continue with the next
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
    if x == "banana":
        continue
    print(x)
