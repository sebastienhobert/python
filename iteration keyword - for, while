# ITERATION KEYWORD - while
# Initialize a variable i with the value 0
# Start a while loop that continues executing as long as the condition i < 10 is true
# Inside the loop, check if the current value of i is equal to 6
# If the condition i == 6 is true, increment the value of i by 1
# Set "continue" statement, so the control go back to the beginning of the loop without executing the remaining code
# If the condition i == 6 is false, execute the code inside an "else" block
# Print the current value of i followed by a space, without moving to the next line
# Increment the value of i by 1
i = 0
