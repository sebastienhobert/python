# ITERATION KEYWORD - for
# Start a "for" loop that iterates over the numbers from 0 to 9 (10 exclusive)
# (in each iteration, the variable i takes on the next value in the range)
# Print the current value of i followed by a space, without moving to the next line
# Check if the current value of i is equal to 6
# If the condition i == 6 is true, execute "break" statement, which immediately exits the loop
# Prints a newline character, moving the cursor to the next line
# (this print statement is outside the loop, so it is executed after the loop has completed or after the loop 
# has been terminated by the break statement)
for i in range(10):
    print(i, end=" ")
    if i == 6:
        break
print()



# ITERATION KEYWORD - while
# Initialize a variable i with the value 0
# Start a while loop that continues executing as long as the condition i < 10 is true
# Inside the loop, check if the current value of i is equal to 6
# If the condition i == 6 is true, increment the value of i by 1
# Set "continue" statement, so the control go back to the beginning of the loop without executing the remaining code
# If the condition i == 6 is false, execute the code inside an "else" block
# Print the current value of i followed by a space, without moving to the next line
# Increment the value of i by 1
i = 0
while i < 10:
    if i == 6:
        i += 1
        continue
