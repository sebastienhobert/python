#The while Loop
#With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as the condition is true
#ex: print i as long as i is less than 6:
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1


#The break Statement
#With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
#Example: exit the loop when i is 3:
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    if i == 3:
        break
    i += 1


#The continue Statement
#With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
i = 0
while i < 6:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i) #it will display 1 2 4 5 6, so number 3 is missing
    
    
#The else Statement
#With the else statement we can run a block of code when the condition is no longer true
#Print a message once the condition is false
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print("i is no longer less than 6")
