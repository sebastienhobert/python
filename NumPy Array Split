SPLITTING NUMPY ARRAYS

Splitting is reverse operation of joining.
Splitting breaks one array into multiple.
Joining merges multiple arrays into one.
We use array_split() for splitting arrays, we pass it the array we want to split and the number of splits.
"""
#Ex: split the array in 3 parts
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
newarr = np.array_split(arr, 3)
print(newarr)
#Note- the return value is a list containing three arrays

"""If the array has less elements than required, it will adjust from the end accordingly"""
#Ex: split the array in 4 parts
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
newarr = np.array_split(arr, 4)
print(newarr)
#Note- we also have the method split() available but it will not adjust the elements when elements are less in source array like in example above, array_split() worked properly but split would fail
