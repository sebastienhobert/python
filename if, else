#Elif
#The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
a = 666
b = 666
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")


#Else
#The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")


#In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".
#You can also have an else without the elif:
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")
