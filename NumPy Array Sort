SORTING ARRAYS
Sorting means putting elements in an ordered sequence.
Ordered sequence is any sequence that has an order corresponding to elements, like numeric or alphabetical, ascending or descending.
The NumPy ndarray object has a function called sort(), that will sort a specific array.

#Ex: sort the array
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([3, 2, 0, 1])
print(np.sort(arr))

#Ex: sort the array alphabetically
import numpy as np
arr = np.array(['banana', 'cherry', 'apple'])
print(np.sort(arr))
