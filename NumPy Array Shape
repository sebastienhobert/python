"""
SHAPE OF AN ARRAY
The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.
"""

"""
GET THE SHAPE OF AN ARRAY
NumPy arrays have an attribute called shape that returns a tuple with each index having the number of corresponding elements. 
"""
# Ex: print the shape of a 2-D array
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])
print(arr.shape)
# The example above returns (2, 4) which means that the array has 2 dimensions, where the first dimension has 2 elements and the second has 4

# Ex: create an array with 5 dimensions using ndmin using a vector with values 1, 2, 3, 4 and verify that last dimension has value 4
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin = 5)
print(arr)
print('shape of an array :', arr.shape)

"""
WHAT DOES THE SHAPE TUPLE REPRESENT?
Integers at every index tells about the number of elements the corresponding dimension has.
In the example above at index-4 we have value 4, so we can say that 5th (4 + 1 th) dimension has 4 elements
