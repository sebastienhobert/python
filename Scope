"""
A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope.

"""
LOCAL SCOPE
A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.
"""
#Ex: a variable created inside a function is available inside a function
def myfunc():
    x = 300
    print(x)
    
myfunc()



"""
FUNCTION INSIDE A FUNCTION
As explained in the example above, the variable x is not available outside the function, but it is available for any function inside the function
"""
#Ex: the local variable can be accessed from a function within the function
def myfunc():
    x = 300
    def myinnerfunc():
        print(x)
    myinnerfunc()
    
myfunc()
