"""
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class 
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class 
"""

"""
CREATE A PARENT CLASS
Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class
Ex: create a class named Person with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method: 
"""
class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
        
    def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
        
#Use the Person class to create an object, an then execute the printname method:
x = Person("Sebastien", "HOBERT")
x.printname()



"""
CREATE A CHILD CLASS
To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class:
Ex: create a class named Student, which will inherit the properties and methods from the Person Class:
"""
class Student(Person):
    pass
"""
Now the Student class has the same properties and methods as the Person Class
Ex: use the Student class to create an object, and then execute the printname method: 
"""
x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()
