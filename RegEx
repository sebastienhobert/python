REGEX
A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.
"""

"""
RegEx Module
Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.
"""
#ex: Import the re module
import re



"""
REGEX IN PYTHON
When you have imported the re module, you can start using regular expressions
"""
#ex: search the string to see if it starts with "The" and ends with "Spain"
import re 
txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search ("^The.*Spain$", txt)



"""
THE FINDALL() FUNCTION
The findall() function returns a list containing all matches 
"""
#Ex: print a list of all matches
import re 
txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.findall("ai", txt)
print(x)



"""
If no matches are found, the value None is returned:
"""
#Ex: Make a search that returns no match:
import re
txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("Portugal", txt)
print(x)



"""
THE SPLIT() FUNCTION
The split() function returns a list where the string has been split at each match
"""
#Ex: split at each white-space character
import re
txt = "The rain in spain"
x = re.split("\s", txt)
print(x)
